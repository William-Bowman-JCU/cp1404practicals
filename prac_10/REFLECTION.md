# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Usually around a 5 minute difference 

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I thought I'd spend alot more time on the tasks than I actually did, so my beginning estimates were more inaccurate

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I'm not too sure, I don't really see a difference in my coding process after doing my estimates, I got better at writing estimates but outside of that not much

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Where I can improve code and things I may have missed in the lectures

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I've seen how others go about writing their code and why they might do things differently, even though we aren't too different as we get the same result 

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[https://github.com/Pandiarchana/CP1404/pull/3]()

### Explanation

While I was review their coed I took note of their commit history, and notices it was very sudden, instead of commiting as you go.

### Good Code Review 2

[https://github.com/taylabender/cp1404_practicals/pull/3]()

### Explanation

Honestly a nitpick, their code was great and I couldn't find any errors or things I'd change.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I think it'd be a better weekly flow if we have a main program 'idea':
- In the early weeks we would make that program with normal code
- Then functions & maybe seperating functions into different files then importing them
- Then using Classes and methods, later inheriting classes
- Then incorporating a public library (Kivy) for bit of the program
- Then taking that program, and giving it a web UI (Flask)

The bits through the Tri where we used previous functions and mentioning SRP were good. At the beginning on the Tri where we nod our heads and say we understand SRP is one thing, but then seeing it when we go to use functions later on is better.

The 2 assignments could still be using functions and then classes + Kivy, as we're still being given an entirely different program, but using the teachings on a familiar program each week I think would improve understanding.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Proofreading and revising my code; After I initially write code until it barely works with no errors, I revise and look at ways I could condense it, look for repeated code & make it into a function & where I could add commenzts if it's particularly confusing
